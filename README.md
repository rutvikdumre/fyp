# fyp - AI Powered Social Media Analytics and Benchmarking
# Problem Definition
To come up with a technique to analyze the sentiment of a topic being discussed on a social media platform while considering the influence of the user who has created the content. 
Analyse the data and key attributes such as follower count, likes, shares, among others, of the businesses on social media for getting insights. 
Perform a comparative analysis on similar accounts for competitive benchmarking. Sentiment analysis and NLP will be used to understand the response to the product. 
# Conclusion
Most studies related to sentiment analysis on twitter focus only on content and do not consider the user. This would however not reflect the real situation 
Designed a novel system using Fuzzy logic that would combine multiple attributes of the user to provide a holistic influential score taking into account the popularity score (that looks into the likes and retweets), reach score (that looks into the number of followers) and a pagerank score (that evaluates the retweet and mention relationship between users).
Extended the traditional sentiment analysis approach with our influence score.
Developed a web application that aims to offer social media analytics across twitter to help marketers at brands and agencies create a better social media strategy
Future scope- look at other platforms and add more modules for content automation
